                    We are working across regions in about 70 countries, with thousands of partners, and allies, supporting communities to build better lives for themselves, grow resilience and protect lives and livelihoods also in times of crisis.
                Our ambition is lasting impact. We make a difference by being part of a global movement for social justice.
                We believe in the power of people.

                        Make-A-Wish International is proud of the way it manages and safeguards the generous contributions from individual donors, corporations and other organizations.
                            Make-A-Wish International supports its day-to-day operations, in addition to its 39 affiliates, working to grant wishes across the globe. This includes helping affiliates develop resources, administer programs and referrals, navigate policies and guidelines, and brand advancement.
                            
                            In 2020, more than 82 cents out of every U.S. dollar given to Make-A-Wish International helped grant the wishes of 11,581 children living with critical illnesses globally.
                            
                            $9.1M was raised in FY20 by Make-A-Wish International and $55.8M globally by Make-A-Wish Affiliates.

                        Our vision, our mission and our work are all defined by one goal â€“ ending extreme poverty, whatever it takes. We believe that no-one should have to live in fear that they won't have a home to sleep in or enough food to feed their children. 

            For over 50 years we have been working with the world's poorest people to transform their lives.
Today we are a team of over 3,500 highly skilled and dedicated professionals from 50 countries who share an exceptional depth and diversity of experience.


Each year our specialist teams work with 25 million people living on less than $2 a day, from war zones in Syria and Somalia to devastating floods in Bangladesh.
